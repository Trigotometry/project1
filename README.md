### **A Basic Forum.**

#### General Assembly â€” SEI-31

The task was to build an app using Ruby on Rails in conjunction with the rest of the technologies we've learned over the past 6 weeks namely, *Ruby on Rails*, *JavaScript*, *jQuery*, *HTML*, *CSS* and *Bootstrap* for my front end framework. An open brief gave me the opportunity to deliver whatever I wanted ... I chose to try and deliver a very basic forum system within the week.

This was immensely difficult but a fantastically rewarding process (even though I didn't manage to deliver all my initial ideas). This was the first project where I went from ideation to delivery. Going into the project I found that I had an okay foundation with the with the CRUD systems of the backend.
